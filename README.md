# Magic Support

Some small niceties to help working with Magic. So far:

* Get all the cards from all magic sets (via [Scryfall](https://scryfall.com/)) in csvs in an import friendly format, so that it'd be nice to put in and import (for now just Archidekt)
* or just the cards from one set

## Setup

* Recent elixir & erlang (concrete versions see `.tool-versions`)
* `mix deps.get`
* `iex -S mix`
* From here use the functions documented in the `Magic` module.
